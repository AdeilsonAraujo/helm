--------Please be patient while the chart is being deployed--------

Tip: Watch the app deployment status using the command: kubectl get pods -n cloudcasa-io

Monitor the CloudCasa UI's Setup tab. The cluster state should change from Pending to Ready. If the cluster state remains Pending, you may have provided the wrong Cluster ID.
